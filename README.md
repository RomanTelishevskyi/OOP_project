My project theme is "monsters". I thought of the idea of making monsters as chess pieces. Each one will have a method, "legal_move". I want to create an abstract base class Monster which will have this method and a field "starting position" , then a hierarchy of Monsters, for example class Cthulhu can inherit from Monsters and calling method "legal_move" will show the way how this piece moves from a certain position.
