My project theme is "monsters". I want to create an abstract base class Monster, than a hierarchy of Monsters, for example class Slavic_monsters can inherit from Monsters, and different monsters from slavic folklore(e.g. Babay, Koschei)would inherit from this class. They would have polymorphic method that "tells their story". Is this idea is suitable for this project? By the by, I am planing on using Java.
