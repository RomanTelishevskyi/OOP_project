My project theme is "monsters". I thought of the idea of making monsters as chess pieces. Each one will have a method, "legal_move". I want to create an abstract base class Monster which will have this method and 2 fields - String "starting position" and array of Strings of "possible moves", then a hierarchy of Monsters, for example class Witch can inherit from Monsters and calling method "legal_move" will show the way how this piece moves from a certain position (maybe as an ASCII art).
